## JOB ANALYSIS PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts job market trends using classical machine learning algorithms.
The main goal is to forecast important job attributes based on structured data, assisting job seekers and HR professionals in making informed decisions.
The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — without the use of deep learning methods.
