## JOB ANALYSIS PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts job market trends using classical machine learning algorithms.
The main goal is to forecast important job attributes based on structured data, assisting job seekers and HR professionals in making informed decisions.
The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — without the use of deep learning methods.

## Tools & Technologies Used
 * Python: Core programming language.
 * Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
 * Seaborn / Matplotlib: Data visualization.
 * Scikit-learn: Building Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
 * XGBoost: Implementing an advanced gradient boosting model.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded structured data related to job profiles.

Handled missing values appropriately.

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Split data into features (X) and target (y) variables.

2. Model Building
Trained the following machine learning models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

3. Model Evaluation
Compared the performances of all models based on evaluation metrics.

Visualized confusion matrices for better interpretation of model predictions.
