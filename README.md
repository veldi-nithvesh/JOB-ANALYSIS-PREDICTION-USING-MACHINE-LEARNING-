# JOB ANALYSIS PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict job market trends and salary outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. The insights provided are valuable for HR professionals and job seekers to forecast the demand for specific job roles and identify the required competencies.

## Tools Used
- Python: Programming language used for implementing the project.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- NLTK / SpaCy: Libraries for natural language processing.
- XGBoost / Random Forest: Advanced machine learning algorithms used for prediction.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: 
   - Gather structured data (e.g., salary, experience, education level) and unstructured data (e.g., job descriptions, resumes).
   - Clean the data to handle missing values and normalize it for consistency.
   - Apply tokenization and other NLP techniques to convert text data into a suitable format.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Extract relevant features from both structured and unstructured data.
   - Use methods like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and named entity recognition (NER) for text features.

3. Model Building:
   - Implement machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Linear Regression.
   - Train the models on a training dataset and evaluate them using a testing set.
   - Use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.

4. Prediction and Insights:
   - Integrate the models into a system capable of handling real-time data.
   - Predict salaries, classify job roles, and identify key skills from new job-related data.
   - Provide actionable insights to HR professionals and job seekers.
