## JOB ANALYSIS PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict job market trends using classical machine learning algorithms.
The goal is to forecast important job attributes based on available data, helping job seekers and HR professionals make better decisions.
The project covers the entire ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation without using any deep learning methods.
________________________________________Tools & Technologies Used
•	Python: Core programming language.
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
•	Seaborn / Matplotlib: For data visualization.
•	Scikit-learn: For building Decision Tree and Random Forest models.  
•	XGBoost: For implementing an advanced gradient boosting model.

## Project Workflow
1.	Data Preprocessing
o	Loaded structured data related to job profiles.
o	Handled missing values appropriately.
o	Encoded categorical variables using label encoding.
o	Split data into features (X) and target (y) variables.
2.	Model Building
o	Trained the following machine learning models:
o	Decision Tree Classifier
o	Random Forest Classifier
o	XGBoost Classifier
o	Evaluated models based on:
o	Accuracy Score
o	Confusion Matrix
o	Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
3.	Model Evaluation
o	Compared model performances based on evaluation metrics.
o	Visualized confusion matrices for better understanding of model predictions.
